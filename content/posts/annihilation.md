description: "What if—hear me out—the metaphor doesn’t go far enough?"

## 1.

Annihilation is decent sci-fi. 

We can probably fit it into the same conversation as Tarkovsky’s Solaris and Stalker, and others of the same ilk. And I don’t say that because I think Annihilation is comparable in quality to those movies (although it’s probably close in some ways). Rather, the common thread is that they all exist first and foremost as metaphor.

What discouraged me about Annihilation is that the metaphor doesn’t seem to go far enough. The movie is overwhelmingly about cancer, which is made painfully obvious by the opening scene. But it could be so much more.

I’ll get to what I mean by that, but first I’ll drop in my two cents about how the movie performs visually. And I’ll preface this section by saying that I don’t think I’m qualified to make a comprehensive analysis of the cinematography. 

Nevertheless, here it is.

The movie is, on the whole, shot beautifully. It was directed by Alex Garland, whom I know from Ex Machina, which was not terrible and much more commercially accessible if you haven’t watched it [^1]. 

There were many good decisions throughout the film – the most impactful to me was that the background was almost always in focus. And this is especially true once the protagonists enter the shimmer. Keeping the background ever-present helps the whole thing feel more surreal and yet remain human at its core. I’m not sure I’m getting my point across with that so let’s put it this way. I think that it prevents the movie’s plot from degrading into what could easily be a soapy walking simulator with dramatic interjections. 

The overall design of the shimmer is adequate—it shimmers so it’s *THE* shimmer, get it? I haven’t read the source material but this gets the job done. It makes it always obvious that there’s something off about the world around them without being too visually abrasive. I do, however, have a few minor gripes about the scene design in general.

While the movie looks great, the way it was shot also allows for a few very powerful sequences that would have been possible with a more traditional approach. The big-money scenes mostly fall flat with a few exceptions. I get the feeling that was very deliberately done to never lose sight of the fact that this movie is about cancer (and that’s a solemn topic don’t you know). At times, though, I just wish there was more of a commitment one way or the other. 

The animal attack scenes felt tacked on to me. In my view, if you’re making a moody exploration of grief and betrayal or what-have-you, there’s no room for gatorsharks and gorebears tearing people to ribbons. The plot, by and large, sticks to the notion that whatever’s going in the shimmer is going to happen to you *from within*. That’s why I don’t like these digressions with the animals that feel like exogenous interruptions to the overall theme. 

I did find it to be very clever to pull a Columbo during the initial stages o the interrogation. The sole-survivor setup removes a lot of the tension and basically allowed me to spectate placidly even as horrific things are happening to the characters. 

All that aside, the gorebear was a fantastic creature, and whoever designed it should be proud. 

The fungus-man scene is different. It seems to fit the mission of the movie—which is that you’re gonna get got, basically. If you fight it, you’re just gonna stop happening in a worse way. And… it comes from within.

And I guess that’s all I have to say about that. I’ll jump into the (maybe overly) academic points I want to make. But, just for a second, I’d like to address the female elephant in the room. 

What is the point of making it an all-female ensemble cast?

There is no point.

Here’s the deal.

Whatever the movie is about (and we can disagree about that), it’s definitely not about aliens. Movies about aliens have a very distinct, for lack of a better term, *feel* to them. I’m not saying it’s necessary for the genre but there is an unmistakable expectation about alien movies that this does not and should not have. 

What I’m leading up to is the opinion that putting an alien at the nucleus of the plot is a mistake. Instead, I’ll make the case that the shimmer should merely be a phenomenon. Here’s why:

If we’re dealing with an entity—alien in this case—we have to assume that it has discretion, agency, and (most egregiously) an agenda to a greater or lesser degree. Now, clearly, the screenwriter saw this issue and decided to deal with it by capping off the movie with a throwaway line from our protagonist to the effect that “it didn’t want anything”. Sorry, but not good enough. It did want something, and now we’re left wondering what it is, and by extension what the hell cancer “wants” because, and I cannot stress this enough, the movie is about cancer.

Entities have goals, and we can present those goals as unfathomable and simply beyond our understanding but that is—in my view—lazy writing (at this point, I would pointedly stare at a copy of any Lovecraft or Robert Chambers book if I had one around; Lovecraft, by the way, died of cancer and I’d like to think he would have liked this movie).

A phenomenon, on the other hand, is a different matter altogether. It doesn’t distract our thought process by having us wonder about its motives or origins. For the sake of comparison, let’s consider two movies that are structurally identical but one has an entity as the story driver while the other has a phenomenon. 

I’m sure we could come up with a lot of examples but an easy one is Independence Day versus The Day After Tomorrow. Here, I’m not going to engage in a deep-enough digression to explain why this is a good example, but simply think about these two movies for two seconds and you’ll see how important it is for the plot device to be an entity versus a phenomenon and how each shapes the movies in completely different ways. 

So, I contend that the meteorite that lands at the start of the movie should have been the bearer of a phenomenon. Think of it like an ice nucleating particle that sets in motion a chain of events that cannot be stopped unless a certain set of conditions is changed. And, it would even play along much better as part of the terrible cancer metaphor. Since cancer isn’t alien, it’s a phenomenon that happens under certain conditions and doesn’t have an agenda or goals. 

One instance in which the movie succeeds quite well is in getting across the weight and nuance of its secondary theme—self-destruction. In particular, the relationship between our protagonist and her husband plays out in a way that is both real and tragic. This relationship is the emotional heart of the movie and creates the space to ask the question: why do we choose to stay on a path that we know ends in our ultimate demise? Why do we see the lighthouse and continue to sail toward the shore? 

The perfect scene where this crystallizes is in the bedroom scene with Lena and the other Ph.D. she’s been having an affair with. He says something along the lines of “it’s not me you hate, it’s yourself” to which she replies “no, it’s **you too**.”

And now I’m going to risk swimming well beyond my depths and try to view this aspect of the movie through the lens of Freudian psychoanalysis. In its exploration of self-destruction, the movie reframes Freud’s Eros/Thanatos conflict in a slightly different light. The way we see it play out in the movie, Thanatos does not oppose Eros but rather each is an inevitable consequence of the other. And, if that’s the case, what do we do about that? Is it correct to rush headlong into annihilation for the sake of accelerating future creation (that might turn out to be twisted, malformed, or otherwise other than what we wanted or expected), or do we linger and bide our time until there’s a better chance for our metaphoric demise to produce something worthy of the suffering?
