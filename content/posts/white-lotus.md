Alright, welcome to another installment of the "Don't Let Them Style On You" series of essays wherein I walk you through my brain flatulence w/r/t the second season of the White Lotus.

By the way, thanks for the rec. It didn't disappoint.

## 1.

Let's start with the opening sequence. What a tour-de-France that baby is huh? I can honestly say we didn't skip it a single time; which, given how long the thing lasts, is a credit to its creators. The song is a banger too. I was doing the ululations along with the music every time. I'm going to call it right here right now: White Lotus Sicily theme song remix is going to be the song of the summer.

The whole thing just works on so many levels and I'm sure there's a YouTube mini-doc about the making of the title sequence, but let's move on to the meat of the show.

I guess the first thing to note is that the show is beautifully shot, as you well pointed out. The camera work is top-hole and really seems to capture the Sicilian setting as if they were shooting a longform ad for Italy's National Tourist Board.

Here's what I'd say if I was pretending to know what the hell I'm talking about:

Every shot is meticulously crafted, imbuing the show with a sense of grandeur and opulence that perfectly reflects the high stakes and intense desires of its characters. The visual language of the show is impeccable, inviting the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the lavish world of the White Lotus and the complex, tumultuous relationships that unfold within its walls.

The most interesting part of the show, in my opinion, is how quickly the stunning setting takes a back seat to the characters and their storylines. This is a testament to the strength of the writing and clever use of the telenovela structure. While the show avoids the often slow pacing of a soap opera, it retains the flagship feature of removing financial limitations from the central plot (a key aspect of telenovelas), which I believe will allow it to continue to be engaging in the long run since it's always going to be the case that the characters are at a high-end resort. All in all, it's a very clever approach.

And, this extirpation of mundane pecuniary concerns is also a central ideological feature of the show. But—to quote every hacky true-crime podcast show host ever—*more on that later...*

Let's talk characters. First and foremost, I disagree with you about Chrissy Moltisanti. I think he did a fine job. I'm not saying he deserves an Emmy or whatever the hell they're giving out these days but it's a fine performance under the circumstances. The scenes where he's talking to his wife[^1] and seems completely unfazed by how upset she is are the most relatable, in my view. He's just a huge piece of shit who's only upset because he's not getting everything he wants on his terms. And, true to the overarching theme of the show, the solution to all his problems is ultimately money.

Tanya definitely steals the show and I want to shake the hand of whomever wrote her lines. Gems like "did you knit your little hat?", "I was told that the cheese here was made by a blind nun in a basement", and "is that the queen of Sicily?" will rattle around in the ol' brain cage for years to come. She's also a very interesting case of someone who is self-aware and idiotic at the same time. In a weird way, her utter obliviousness juxtaposed with moments of grounded clarity make her the most complex character in the show. It just takes a long time for that complexity to come through.

And who can forget Tanya's nails-on-chalkboard timbre as she proudly declares "I'm Monica Vitti!" to hotel manager Valentina, only to get skewered with a stare and the line "Monica Vitti is dead." Parenthetically, Monica Vitti died earlier this year, so that scene must have been shot very recently. That, or they shot it with the expectation that Monica Vitti would die.

Ethan and Harper's Sicilian vacation ends up providing them with precisely what they need, even though they initially arrive with unclear expectations and a sense of superiority over their less educated companions, Cameron and Daphne. I felt like there was room to develop them more and probably would have been a little more emotionally impactful if we had some more substance about their lives. Ethan's set up to be a real brainiac so I like that he's able to see through Cam's intentions when he hits him with the mimetic desire speech; that makes sense. Despite this, his ability to sus out Cam ultimately proves insignificant in the grand scheme of things, which is somewhat frustrating. On the other hand, Cameron's douche move serves as the catalyst for the growth of E and H's relationship. That whole dynamic was well-crafted and I think probably doesn't get the attention it deserves.

A side character that also makes a big impression is Quentin. Tom Hollander, whom you might remember from your favorite motion picture as the evil British guy trying to steal Davy Jones's heart from captain Jack Sparrow, delivers a fantastic performance. I think Quentin is, in large part, so memorable because he's playing off Jennifer Coolidge most the time. I mean, just look at this stare he gives Tanya when she asks him if the lady sitting to the left of them is the queen of Sicily. And, the deadpan reply—**yes**—is delivered with such perfect timing that it deserves a standing ovation.

Everyone else is kinda meh to me. Except for... my main squeeze Albert Di Grasso. F. Murray Abraham, god bless him, just knocks it out of the park in this role. Every scene with this man needs to be on the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage. There are too many to count but I'll just let this one make my case:

As we delve deeper into the show, we can't ignore the all-important setting, which falls away at the start but starts to creep back in as the show progresses. Of course, there's the eponymous White Lotus resort, with its opulent surroundings and secluded beachfront. But also the larger setting of Sicily, a place that has a greater impact on the show's plot than any individual character, in my view. Allow me to elaborate.

Throughout the show there are a lot of closeup shots of the scenery, obviously, and in particular they seem to focus on the eyes of the figures and characters in the paintings and sculptures of the world around our protagonists. I think the message there is pretty clear which is that this place is distrustful of outsiders and while you're welcome to visit, chicanery will not be tolerated and the characters are under surveillance. Or, as Daphne puts it "Screw around and you’ll end up buried in the garden". The story of the Testa di Moro pretty explicitly sets this as a thematic element and while I'm not a fan of such heavy-handed metaphor, it works here to keep the show from getting too haughty.

I'm fully on board with the vases and this particular symbolism of infidelity, power roles, sex, and yadda, yadda. However, I'm going to make the case that it goes deeper than that. The heads, the paintings, the gargoyles, and other depictions that fully populate so many shots with such frequency have one important thing in common. Eyes.

And, fair warning, this is the point at which I just start dropping things on the ol' cerebrum and hope something gets caught in the gyri on the way down.

I believe the larger metaphor at play is *the gaze/look*. Jean-Paul Sartre's "gaze" to be more precise. I'm not going to get into the finer points of Sartre's writings (nor do I think I quite grasp them) but I'll just set the stage for the rest of this essay.

In his theory of the "look", Sartre posits that in our interactions with others, we are constantly subjected to the objectifying gaze of others. This objectification, Sartre believed, has the ability to shape and influence our sense of self and our relationships with others, as we are often influenced by how we perceive ourselves through the eyes of others. However, Sartre argued that while this objectification is an inescapable aspect of human relationships, it is essential (and desirable) for individuals to resist the power of the "look" and assert their own agency and freedom in their interactions with others. That is to say, act in a way more true to our authentic nature. In doing so, we can reclaim our sense of self and our place in the world.

I'm sure someone could explain that better than me, but what I'm getting at here is that the setting in The White Lotus serves as a perpetual viewer/observer. It never allows our characters to assert their own agency and act in an authentic way, even when they are alone.

A key moment where the gaze's spell is broken (figuratively and literally) is near the very end when Ethan and Harper accidentally knock over the Testa di Moro vase. They are suddenly freed from the "gaze" and act on their desires which were always there to begin with. They mistake their lack of physical intimacy as something indicative of an endogenous pathology in their relationship when it ends up being exactly the opposite. Their internal desire to present a certain way to the gazing world is what ultimately keeps their proverbial b-holes clenched and unable to express themselves freely. When the head breaks, finally, no one is watching and the façade can drop.

The pattern of characters being trapped in the objectifying gaze throughout the show and eventually learning to resist the objectification and reclaiming their agency (if only partially) repeats for everyone. Sadly, for some it comes too late. 

Cameron and Daphne seem, superficially, to be the most inured from the gaze at first. But as the season progresses, it becomes clear that they are both deeply invested in maintaining the appearance of a happy, monogamous relationship despite their open secret. In a moment of ominous sobriety, we see Cameron furiously flossing his teeth and staring into the bathroom mirror like a complete psychopath. As Daphne calls out to him from the bedroom to Facetime with their children, he quickly composes himself, donning the mask of a doting husband once again. It's a telling moment, demonstrating just how trapped Cameron and Daphne are in the objectifying gaze of the world around them, and how they (or at least he) live in constant state of antagonism with their own selves.

The Di Grasso family is also an excellent case study into how the gaze affects behavior. Here we have, essentially, one character cleft into three.

Albie is the naïve individual, still under the impression that it's by virtue of his own agency that he makes decisions and remains almost unaware of the gaze's influence. Nowhere is that more apparent than when he tries to deliver an extemporaneous analysis of machismo in The Godfather to his dad and grandfather and ends up sounding utterly unconvincing and derivative. And throughout the season, it becomes clear that Albie's nice-guy persona is just that... He's not actually all that nice, he just wants to get his weasel greased. The only thing that he seems upset by is that his machinations with Portia don't end up working out the way he expects.

Dominic, on the other hand, is the individual that has come to terms with his lack of agency. Rather than resist, he knows that he must act in service of the gaze but has resigned himself to it and goes to extreme lengths to satisfy every gaze while simultaneously trying to keep his authentic self unwitnessed. It doesn't take a 200 IQ supergenius to realize that his behavior is both unsustainable and self-defeating, but he's not ready to stand up to the gaze quite yet.

And, lastly, Bert is the individual who has made it to the other side. Freed from the gaze and apparently acting with callous disregard to the civil inattention of others. He is a true embodiment of Sartre's idea of reclaiming one's sense of self and agency, and serves as a foil to the other characters who are still trapped in the cycle of trying to please and appease the gaze of others. He also caries a warning. A reminder that acting authentically means sometimes looking and behaving like a fool.

Together, the family serves as a complex cautionary tale. On the one hand, we need to be aware of the world around us. As Dominic puts it to Albie: "how are you going to make it in life if you're this big a mark?" And on the other hand, we see that radical freedom, while attractive in some ways, has a way of getting away from us and turning into more of a vice than a virtue.

Tanya is the most extreme case of the individual so trapped in the gaze that there is no realistic way of ever making it back. There is no self to return to because she was never given the chance to build anything of substance to begin with that wasn't a refraction of her environment. Consider the question she asks Quentin in this scene and the context in which she asks it.

As Quentin foreshadows several times, Tanya ends up being a Puccinian heroine in the end. When the last gaze is averted, she finally tries to marshal an escape into self-agency. But there's nothing on the other side of the wall; and that's exactly what she ends up finding.

Now I'll try to develop a position that I find difficult to articulate and it's going to be half-baked so just put up the lane bumpers because once I release this bowling ball, there's no telling where she's off to.

The White Lotus is an example of what I like to call eat-the-rich satire. Taking aim at the absurdity of late-stage capitalism and seemingly poking fun at those who reap the benefits of these absurdities. At least, that's the surface level interpretation. But even a cursory glance below that surface reveals a deeply cynical and much more underhanded agenda than a simple satirical lens through which to view opulence. I'll elaborate.

First, let's start with the simple fact that the show was conceived, created, and disseminated by decision of those very people that it purports to caricature. That is to say, every decision-maker responsible for putting the show before our eyes is rich. And not just prefab-house-in-the-suburbs rich but actual millionaires. This inherent hypocrisy undermines the supposed critique of wealth and privilege that the show undertakes. As a quick aside, I never did get the whole "I recognize my privilege" intellectual position; as if that substantially changes anything at all. But even setting this aside, it's clear to me that The White Lotus is part of a larger trend of commodified satire, aimed at appearing revolutionary in spirit while really serving only to discourage any genuine revolutionary action.

Other examples of this type of superficial critique include Triangle of Sadness, The Menu, and Parasite. These works may be entertaining (and I'll go so far as to say that they are entertaining), but they are ultimately designed to pacify the working class, rather than inspire them to challenge the status quo. The self-deprecating satire feels disingenuous and contrived.

When we consider the reasons why people make fun of a particular group, in the main, there are two possibilities: either the speaker is part of the in-group and wants to signal their belonging through shared humor, or the speaker is attempting to preemptively self-deprecate in order to disarm potential criticism. I think the White Lotus is a case of the latter masquerading as the former.

It's a how-do-you-do-fellow-kids type of charade that ultimately works. And it works mainly because we, the viewers and enjoyers of the show, *want* it to work. It's very appealing to let ourselves laugh at the entitlement and shortcomings of these people apparently brought low by their excess. It allows us to achieve a baseless sense of superiority over the bourgeoise and appeases resentment.

And to some degree it works because we want to believe that it's true. We want to believe that being filthy rich isn't all it's cut out to be. But let's be brutally honest, all the same problems in that show happen to working class people too, they're just a lot less glamorous and way shittier. The answer to the question "do you wanna make shedloads of friggin' money?" is most assuredly yes.

And it also works because, to some degree I think most of us in the developed world realize that we're not exactly in a position to cast aspersions on the wealthy. We've all seen the child of Omelas and we're perfectly happy to studiously ignore it while producing pseudo-intellectual horseshit like yrstruly has done here. After all, are we or are we not temporarily embarassed billionaires biding our time until it's our turn to enjoy the good life?

And that brings me to our proxy in the show: the lovely Portia. Portia is the odd (wo)man out in the group. The one who has internalized the idea that she should want to belong to this exclusive club but knows that she never will and so resorts to pointing out character flaws in those who do. Everything from her extremely questionable fashion choices to the fact that Greg literally asks "what the hell is she doing here?" is meant to underscore the fact that Portia is only allowed to hear the sound of the Shofar for the sake of convenience, but remains goyim nonetheless.

Ultimately, Portia is allowed to leave unscathed; to deliver a warning to otherse like her. But not before being made painfully aware that the gilded walls of the garden are, both, dizzying in height and clad in vicious ivy. Her only real path to ascend them ends up to be let in the front door. And that's the opportunity she's given in the final scene at the airport with Albie.

Ethan, on the other hand, seems to be a relatively self-made man. Not as in "started from the bottom now we're here" but managed to leverage a good start in life into a ticket to the high-rollers club. And he almost gets away with being the exception that proves the rule. But he doesn't get to just waltz his way up the ladder. There's a price to pay for playing at this table, and Cameron is dead-set on extracting it, which he ultimately does. I think the airport scene for Ethan and Harper is them coming to terms with what they had to give up. They've paid the price and somehow made it through, now they can move on. Now they're in. Their naïve drive to save the world gives way to the fact that we are all bound by the constraints of the human condition, and true freedom comes from striving to live authentically and with purpose despite these limitations.

Oh and yeah, Cameron's enchilada in that one scene was confirmed to be a prosthetic
